<h3 class="heading-medium">Measuring website usage (Piwik)</h3>

<p>We use Piwik Analytics software to collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We do this to better understand how applicants for legalisation use the website. From time to time, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, eg, by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p><span>Piwik Analytics sets the following cookies:</span></p>

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Expires</th></tr>
<tr><td>_pk_ref</td><td>Tracking of web site usage</td><td>Two years</td></tr>
<tr><td>_pk_cvar</td><td>Tracking of web site usage</td><td>Two years</td></tr>
<tr><td>_pk_id</td><td>Tracking of web site usage</td><td>Two years</td></tr>
<tr><td>_pk_ses</td><td>Tracking of web site usage</td><td>Two years</td></tr>
