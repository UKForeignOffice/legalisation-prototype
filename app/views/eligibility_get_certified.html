<!-- Docs to certify -->
<p>Before submitting your application you need to get the following document certified:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>degree certificate or transcript (UK)</li>
        </ul>	
	
        <!-- Certifying Documents -->
        <h3 class="heading-medium">Certifying documents</h3>
        <p>Certain documents must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’ before they can be legalised.</p>
        <p>When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)</li>
            <li>use their personal signature, not a company signature</li>
            <li>include the date of certification</li>
            <li>include their company address</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.</p>

        <p>If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.</p>
